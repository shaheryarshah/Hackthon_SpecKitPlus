outcome: "Successfully completed the implementation planning for the hero section and book logo feature. Created comprehensive plan with technical context, constitution check, project structure, research findings, data model, contracts, and quickstart guide. All constitution gates passed and agent context was updated."
evaluation: "The planning phase is thoroughly completed with all required artifacts generated. The solution is well-aligned with the project constitution, uses appropriate technologies (Docusaurus, React), and addresses all requirements from the specification. The plan is ready to proceed to task generation."

# Prompt History Record

## User Input

/sp.plan now create plan based on specification

## Assistant Response

Successfully executed the implementation planning workflow for the hero section and book logo feature:

1. Loaded the feature specification and project constitution
2. Filled the Technical Context with appropriate technologies (React, Docusaurus, etc.)
3. Completed the Constitution Check with all gates passing
4. Generated research.md resolving all clarification points:
   - Futuristic design using glass-morphism effects, neon colors, and geometric shapes
   - WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility compliance
   - Technology stack using React components within Docusaurus framework
5. Created data-model.md with component properties and schema
6. Generated contracts for the HeroSection component interface
7. Created quickstart.md with implementation steps
8. Updated agent context with new technology information
9. Re-evaluated Constitution Check post-design (all continue to pass)
10. Updated the project structure to reflect actual implementation approach

All required planning artifacts have been created and the plan is ready for the next phase.
