# Specification Process: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

This file outlines the specification process for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook project.

## Purpose

The specification process defines the requirements, scope, and success criteria for the textbook project before implementation begins.

## Specification Structure

Each feature specification should contain:

1. **Overview**: Brief description of the feature and its value
2. **User Stories**: Specific scenarios from the perspective of different user types
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear conditions that must be met for the feature to be considered complete
4. **Requirements**: Technical, performance, security, and other requirements
5. **Constraints**: Limitations and boundaries of the feature
6. **Assumptions**: Assumptions made during specification
7. **Dependencies**: External dependencies and their implications
8. **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes that indicate the feature is successful

## Process Steps

1. **Define the Problem**: Clearly articulate the problem the textbook aims to solve
2. **Identify User Personas**: Define the target audience for the textbook
3. **Create User Stories**: Write user stories in the format "As a [persona], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]"
4. **Define Acceptance Criteria**: Specify clear, testable acceptance criteria for each story
5. **Identify Requirements**: List functional, non-functional, technical, and business requirements
6. **Validate Specifications**: Review with stakeholders to ensure completeness and accuracy
7. **Approve Specifications**: Obtain formal approval before moving to the planning phase

## Quality Gates

Before proceeding to the planning phase, ensure:

1. All user stories are clear and actionable
2. Acceptance criteria are testable and measurable
3. All requirements are documented and validated
4. The specification aligns with the project constitution
5. All stakeholders have reviewed and approved the specification
