# Planning Process: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

This file defines the planning process for implementing the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook project.

## Purpose

The planning process translates the feature specification into a technical implementation plan, defining architecture, technology stack, project structure, and execution tasks.

## Planning Structure

Each implementation plan should contain:

1. **Summary**: Concise overview of the approach and key decisions
2. **Technical Context**: Technology stack, dependencies, constraints, and performance goals
3. **Constitution Check**: Verification that the plan aligns with project principles
4. **Project Structure**: Detailed directory structure and organization
5. **Implementation Phases**: Sequential phases for development
6. **Risk Assessment**: Identification and mitigation strategies for potential risks
7. **Success Metrics**: How to measure the success of the implementation

## Process Steps

1. **Analyze Requirements**: Review the specification to understand all requirements
2. **Select Technology Stack**: Choose appropriate technologies based on requirements
3. **Design Architecture**: Create the system architecture and data models
4. **Plan Implementation**: Break down the work into phases and tasks
5. **Identify Dependencies**: Map dependencies between tasks and components
6. **Risk Analysis**: Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies
7. **Review and Validate**: Ensure the plan aligns with the constitution and requirements

## Quality Gates

Before proceeding to the task breakdown phase, ensure:

1. Technical architecture aligns with requirements
2. Technology choices are justified and documented
3. Implementation phases are logical and achievable
4. All significant risks have mitigation strategies
5. The plan supports the project's success criteria
6. Plan has been reviewed by relevant stakeholders
