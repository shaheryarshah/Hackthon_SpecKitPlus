[post_write_hooks]
# post_write_hooks defines scripts or Python functions that are requested
# to run after the completion of a 'revision' command
#
# format is comma-separated pairs of operation-type=Python function name or path
# where operation-type is one of:
#  "revisions": the revision command
#  "upgrade": the upgrade command
#  "downgrade": the downgrade command
#
# Python function names are resolved with regards to the "version.path"
# setting, where it's probably more clear to use a file path though.
#
# Scripts are resolved relative to the directory in which the .ini file is
# located.
# format is either "exec" or "sub"
#   exec passes the file path as an argument to the given command
#   sub passes the file path as the first argument to the given command
#   (same as exec but the .exe extension is added on Windows)
# hook_args is one or more arguments to be passed to the given command
#   (note: hook_args is *not* comma-separated)
#
# define post_write_hooks here, one per line.
